## Instruction

### 2021

In 2021, I authored my first video courses at Pluralsight.

### 2020

In 2020, I became an author of my own interactive project and hands-on cloud lab at Pluralsight. Each involved writing challenges. The project involved implementing automated tests to provide feedback, and the cloud lab involved writing Terraform to set up a cloud environment for the learner.

### 2018

In 2018, Code School was sunset and courses were migrated to Pluralsight's new Interactive Course offering. My work involved migrating the content and re-implementing many of the interactive challenges to support the new platform.
