## Instruction

### 2016

In 2016 and 2017, I implemented interactive challenges for Code School courses on a variety of languages. This involved creating automated tests to provide feedback on code typed in the browser.

### 2018

In 2018, Code School was sunset and courses were migrated to Pluralsight's new Interactive Course offering. My work involved migrating the content and re-implementing many of the interactive challenges to support the new platform.

### 2020

In 2020, I became an author of my own interactive project and hands-on cloud lab at Pluralsight. Each involved writing challenges, and the project involved implementing automated tests to provide feedback.
