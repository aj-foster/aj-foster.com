# Hello there

I'm AJ, a software developer at Pluralsight.
My interests in education and software lead me to...

- Create interactive content on Pluralsight's Skills platform
- Volunteer with _FIRST_ Tech Challenge events and teams
- Build things that move around the room or light up the screen

Contact me if you are interested in teaching a technical skill, building robots, or making something in the [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) programming language.
