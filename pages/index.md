# Hello there

I'm AJ, a software developer at [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io).
My interests in education and software lead me to...

- Create [educational content](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/aj-foster) on Pluralsight's Skills platform
- Volunteer with _FIRST_ Tech Challenge events and teams (and [make content](https://www.youtube.com/@FTAAJ) about it)
- Build things that move around the room or light up the screen

Contact me if you are interested in teaching a technical skill, building robots, or making something in the [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) programming language.
